The Twelve-Factor App is a methodology for building software-as-a-service (SaaS) applications that are scalable, portable, and maintainable. It was introduced by developers at Heroku and has since become a set of best practices for building modern, cloud-native applications.

Here is an explanation of each of the twelve factors:

---

### 1. **Codebase: One Codebase Tracked in Version Control, Many Deploys**
- **Principle**: A single codebase should be tracked in a version control system like Git. Every environment (development, staging, production, etc.) is just a different deployment of that same codebase.
- **Key Idea**: There is one-to-one correspondence between a codebase and an app. Multiple deployments (e.g., production, staging) share the same code but are deployed in different environments.

---

### 2. **Dependencies: Explicitly Declare and Isolate Dependencies**
- **Principle**: All dependencies (libraries, packages) must be explicitly declared (e.g., in `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, or `package.json`), and the app should never rely on any system-wide libraries.
- **Key Idea**: Dependencies are isolated to ensure consistency across environments. Tools like `pip`, `npm`, `Poetry`, and `Bundler` handle dependencies, making the environment consistent across different machines.

---

### 3. **Config: Store Configurations in the Environment**
- **Principle**: Configuration data, such as database credentials, API keys, and environment-specific variables, should be stored in environment variables (not in the code itself).
- **Key Idea**: Keep configuration separate from code. This ensures that the same code can run across environments, with different configurations for development, staging, and production.

---

### 4. **Backing Services: Treat Backing Services as Attached Resources**
- **Principle**: Treat backing services (databases, caches, messaging systems) as loosely coupled resources. These services should be easily swappable without changing the code.
- **Key Idea**: Any service your app consumes (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS S3) should be treated as a resource. If you want to switch from a local PostgreSQL instance to a cloud-based one, your app shouldn't require any code changes—just configuration changes.

---

### 5. **Build, Release, Run: Strictly Separate Build and Run Stages**
- **Principle**: The build stage (compiling code, fetching dependencies) should be separate from the release stage (combining the build with environment config) and the run stage (executing the app).
- **Key Idea**: Keep your pipeline clean and reproducible. A build should be created once and never altered. Releases are a combination of a build plus the environment configuration, and then the app is run based on that release.

---

### 6. **Processes: Execute the App as One or More Stateless Processes**
- **Principle**: The application should execute as stateless processes, with no reliance on local data or memory between requests. Any persistent data must be stored in a stateful backing service like a database.
- **Key Idea**: Each request is handled independently. The app processes should be stateless, meaning they can be killed or restarted without affecting ongoing work. If state is needed, store it in a database or external storage, not in the process's memory.

---

### 7. **Port Binding: Export Services via Port Binding**
- **Principle**: The app should be self-contained and expose services via port binding (HTTP, WebSockets, etc.) without relying on an external web server like Apache or Nginx.
- **Key Idea**: The app should run as a standalone service that binds to a port to handle incoming requests. This makes it easy to scale and run in containers or platforms like Heroku or Kubernetes, where the platform routes traffic to your app via port binding.

---

### 8. **Concurrency: Scale Out via the Process Model**
- **Principle**: The app should be designed to scale by running multiple identical processes. Different types of work (web requests, background tasks, etc.) should run in different types of processes.
- **Key Idea**: Scaling is achieved by increasing the number of processes (horizontal scaling), not by making a single process handle more work. This could mean having separate processes for web handling, workers for background jobs, and so on.

---

### 9. **Disposability: Maximize Robustness with Fast Startup and Graceful Shutdown**
- **Principle**: Processes should start up quickly and shut down gracefully. This allows for quick scaling, updates, and handling failures without disruption.
- **Key Idea**: The app should be able to start and stop quickly. Fast startup times mean that new instances can handle traffic quickly, and graceful shutdowns mean the app can finish in-progress requests before termination, ensuring robustness and resilience.

---

### 10. **Dev/Prod Parity: Keep Development, Staging, and Production as Similar as Possible**
- **Principle**: Development and production environments should be as similar as possible to avoid surprises when deploying. Minimize the time, people, and tools that differ between dev and prod.
- **Key Idea**: The goal is to reduce the "gap" between development and production environments. If your development environment is drastically different from production, bugs may only appear in production. Using similar stacks and processes across environments reduces this risk.

---

### 11. **Logs: Treat Logs as Event Streams**
- **Principle**: Applications should not manage log files. Instead, they should output logs to `stdout` and `stderr`, allowing external services to aggregate, store, and analyze logs.
- **Key Idea**: The app should write logs as a continuous stream of events (to standard output), which can then be captured and processed by tools like Splunk, ELK Stack, or Papertrail. This keeps logging flexible and decoupled from the app itself.

---

### 12. **Admin Processes: Run Admin/Management Tasks as One-off Processes**
- **Principle**: Administrative tasks (like database migrations, maintenance scripts) should be run as one-off processes in the same environment as the app’s regular processes.
- **Key Idea**: Tasks like database migrations or running periodic scripts should not be hardcoded into the app. They should be run as one-off processes, ensuring that they have the same environment and dependencies as the main app (using the same build and release).
